        Qualcomm is an American public multinational corporation headquartered in San Diego, California, and incorporated in Delaware.[1] It creates 
        intellectual property, semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. It owns patents critical to the CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA mobile communications standards.
        Qualcomm was established in 1985 by Irwin M. Jacobs and six other co-founders. Its early research into CDMA wireless cell phone technology was funded 
        by selling satellite communications systems for commercial trucks. After a heated debate in the wireless industry, the 3G standard was adopted with 
        Qualcomm's CDMA patents incorporated.[2] Afterwards there was a series of legal disputes about pricing for licensing patents required by the standard.
        Over the years, Qualcomm has expanded into selling semiconductor products in a predominantly fabless manufacturing model. It also developed semiconductor 
        components or software for vehicles, watches, laptops, wi-fi, smartphones, and other devices.
